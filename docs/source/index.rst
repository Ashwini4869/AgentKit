Welcome to AgentKit's documentation!
===================================

**AgentKit** offers a unified framework for explicitly constructing a complex human "thought process" from simple natural language prompts.
The user puts together chains of *nodes*, like stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be designed to explicitly enforce a naturally *structured* "thought process".

Different arrangements of nodes could represent different functionalities, allowing the user to integrate various functionalities to build multifunctional agents.

A basic agent could be implemented as simple as a list of prompts for the subtasks and therefore could be designed and tuned by someone *without any programming experience*.
